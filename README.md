## Requirements

One of the most common UI patterns is known as the Master-Detail view.

For this lab, you’ll build an employee directory application with a Master-Detail view. The design is up to you, but you must meet the specs below:

- Build a database with a single employee’s table. Each Employee should have a name, phone number, office number, position, and manager.
- Create a Spring Boot project with a GET route to get all employees.
- Build an Angular app that displays the names of all employees in a list.
- When an employee’s name is clicked, you must display all the details for that employee in another component.
- In the detail component, there must be a delete button that will remove the employee from the list and the database.
